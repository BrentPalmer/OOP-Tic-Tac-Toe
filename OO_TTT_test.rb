# What is a tic tac toe game?

# A board game with two players. We start with an empty 3x3 board.
# One player is "X" the other player is "O". The "X" player goes 1st.
# Two players alternate to mark empty squares. Alternate turns until
# a player gets 3 squares in a row. If all squares are marked and nobody won
# then it is a tie.
